## Use Case 1 – Application Entry & Welcome Message

This module represents the initial setup of the **Palindrome Checker Management System**. It contains the main class `UseCase1PalindromeCheckerApp`, which serves as the entry point of the application.

At this stage, the program:

* Starts execution from the `main()` method
* Displays a welcome message
* Shows the application version (1.0)
* Confirms successful system initialization

No palindrome checking logic is implemented yet.
The purpose of this use case is to establish a clear and structured startup flow for the application.
